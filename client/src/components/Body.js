                            <small><b>Disclosure:</b> I have this mostly set up for demo. Currently the 'Send' button is not actually taking data from the form to send, and it's pulling up your default email. Once my class is done I would revisit this. Step one would be connect the form date into the email and set it up so that it just sends without needing to go back to the person's email. Once this is complete you would have a url to a web-app that you could email. I could also generate you a QR code (or other technology) that you could print and laminate or save to your phone. Then people could scan that to pull up your current survey and go on their merry way while completing it, if you'd like to use it that way.turn Second step would involve wrapping this in an app that would allow you to select which type of question and type it in, building your thing from components.</small>
